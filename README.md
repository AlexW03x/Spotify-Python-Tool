# Spotify-Python-Tool
## What is it?
> This is my first python project focusing on implementing the coding that I've learnt into a tool that may be useful for time to time. It is a graphical user interface designed utilising the **Tkinter** module and fetches data utilising the Spotify API where users will need their **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET**.

## Why Build It?
> I decided to build this project as I identified that Spotify on the desktop version regardless of membership status doesn't have the ability to download songs locally to the computer system so I built it as I want the ability to have all my songs locally too for just incase I travel or go somewhere without internet and want to listen to music whilst working.

## How To Use It?
```python
Utilise the following commands: py -m pip install __module_name__ or python pip install __module_name__ or pip install __module_name__

1. py -m pip install spotipy
2. py -m pip install tk
3. py -m pip install mutagen
4. py -m pip install requests
5. py -m pip install pytube
6. py -m pip install moviepy
```
